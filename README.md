## User Story

```
AS a user, 
I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a table of random users, 
WHEN the user loads the page, 
A table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

* Sort the table by at least one category

* Filter the users by at least one property.
```

## Deployed Application

Here is the URL for the deployed [Employee Tracker Application](https://enigmatic-temple-92548.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.


## Installation

```
1. Go to https://github.com/alek2535/PWA-Budget-Tracker

2. Fork the branch and then click on clone or download

3. Paste copied link after `git clone` into your bash console in your desired directory

4. You should now have access to the repository
```

Since there is a `package.json`, you will need to run `npm install`.

Once you have the dependancies installed run the command:

```
`npm start`
```

Make sure you have MongoDB running in the background.

## Usage

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
